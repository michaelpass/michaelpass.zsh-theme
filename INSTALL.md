# Installation


This theme is packaged as a Zsh theme to make it easier to use if you're already using a Zsh framework. If you don't already use a framework, [@unixorn](https://github.com/unixorn) highly recommends [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom), because it is fast and also supports using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)'s internal plugins/themes. I personally do all of my plugin/theme management through [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), an thus owe its many developers an eternal debt of gratitude.


### Oh My Zsh
1. Move to user $HOME directory (i.e. "~"):
    `cd`
2. Download michaelpass theme from GitHub:
    `git clone git@github.com:michaelpass/michaelpass.zsh-theme michaelpass`
3. Move into newly created directory
    `cd michaelpass` 
4. Copy theme to Zsh/Oh My Zsh themes directory
    `cp michaelpass-zsh.theme $ZSH/themes` # 
5. Edit current theme to `michaelpass`:
    Open `~/.zshrc` and change `ZSH_THEME="..."` to `ZSH_THEME="michaelpass"`. Save.`
6. Reload Zsh config file:
    `source ~/.zshrc`
7. Happy Hacking! ðŸŽ‰


### POSIX-compliance

Note: Simply moving the theme to your ZSH themes folder and changing the current theme to "michaelpass" should work universally, regardless of what Zsh framework you choose.
