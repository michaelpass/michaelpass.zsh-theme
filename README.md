# michaelpass.zsh-theme
My personal ZSH theme. This theme was originally based on Zsh's famous [alanpeabody](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/alanpeabody.zsh-theme) theme and was modified slowly over time to something I personally enjoy coding with.

# Installation
See [INSTALL.md](null)


## Dependencies
- Z shell
- Limited unicode character support in native terminal (for error return markers; otherwise, these render as undecipherable [Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake).)


## How It Works
I basically hacked and spliced [alanpeabody](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/alanpeabody.zsh-theme) code with tips and tricks from @christoomey and his masterfully produced [Thoughtbot lecture series](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/mastering-git). Note: Currently free to access for all GitHub members.
