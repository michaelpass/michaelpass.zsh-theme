# michaelpass.zsh-theme
My personal Zsh theme. This theme was originally based on Zsh's famous [alanpeabody](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/alanpeabody.zsh-theme) theme and was modified slowly over time to something I personally enjoy coding with.

# Installation
See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/michaelpass/michaelpass.zsh-theme/blob/main/INSTALL.md)


## Dependencies
- [Z shell](https://www.zsh.org/) (Ideally installed through your distro's package manager)
- Limited [unicode character support](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60758736/how-to-add-unicode-characters-to-zsh-prompt) in native terminal (for error return markers; otherwise, these render as undecipherable [Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake).)
- Basic Zsh [terminal color](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/148/colorizing-your-terminal-and-shell-environment) support


## How It Works
I basically hacked and spliced [alanpeabody](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/alanpeabody.zsh-theme) code with tips and tricks from [@christoomey](https://github.com/christoomey) and his masterfully produced [Thoughtbot lecture series](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/mastering-git).


Note: This [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com) lecture series is currently free to access for all GitHub members.
